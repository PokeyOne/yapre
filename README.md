# Yet Another Pokey Rendering Engine (in Rust This Time)

![gpl 3 badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-GPL%203.0-blue)

I think this is the 5th time (?) that I have started working on a ray-tracing
rendering engine. Hopefully this time with more follow through as Rust makes
things easier to get setup and running with fewer errors along the way.

The project is in the very early stages right now and there really isn't much
here other than me playing around with using SDL2 in Rust to create a window
and such.
